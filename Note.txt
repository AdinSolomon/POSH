0. TODO
    - Figure out how to parse the table text efficiently...
    - Allow for additions to already-fetched data pls...
    - Merge Catalog and TMS data?




1. Term Master Schedule
    - JSON from course to offerings
2. Course Catalog
    - JSON from course to description, requirements, etc.
3. Professor Data
    - Professor name to ratemyprofessors.com data, link

100. ALL THE COURSE INFO
    - Master JSON file (maybe separated by college?)
        - Course symbol/number (CS 101) maps to:
            - course number
            - course name
            - credits
            - course dscription
            - repeatable?
            - offerings - {fall: {section01: {professor, style, section}, winter: ...}
            - prerequisites (this one might be difficult)
            - co-requisites
            - anything else?
                - maybe point to courses which have this as a prerequisite/co-requisite?

101. How could we design an efficient search strategy?
    - users might want to search by:
        - course symbol/number
        - course name
        - course description
        - requirement directionality
        - offerings
        - credits
